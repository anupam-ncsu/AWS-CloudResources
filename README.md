<summary> My SSH keypair</summary>
<br>
  
I have created my own key pair on my local as such:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "anupam.ncsu@gmail.com"
```
This creates a public private key pair:
```
$home/.ssh/id_rsa
$home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
[Now we can import our own public key to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
